A Minetest mod that creates unstable wormholes.

Creates linked 'space-time rifts' between the player's location and a random location.

The player can travel back and forth via this wormhole, however it is like playing Russian Roulette.
Eventually the wormhole will collapse, potentially killing or stranding the player.
